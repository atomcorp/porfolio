 ☐ colours palette = http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=31J0u0kp-vffJIbkW-fuxrEvWlA
 ☐ nice colour aquamarine = #9bf0e1
 ☐ have the nav at the top and then nicely slide down (100 / slides %) when you move to the next section
 ☐ i think the skills popup should be a new div that is positioned where the og clicked one is and has all the workding, it can be better centered that way
 ☐ make a fancey/non-fancy button  non-fancy just gets rid of all the animations etc
